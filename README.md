# cavity_ladder
Code used for the project "Photon condensation in magnetic cavities: a two leg ladder model" (link to be added)

We used the [ITensors.jl](https://itensor.github.io/ITensors.jl/stable/index.html) library in Julia to implement the DMRG ground state simulations. The file "functions_cavity.jl" contain the functions that use the library ITensors.jl while the file "cavity_notebook.iybn" is a jupyter notebook (still in Julia) that call our custom functions.

Implemented by Zeno Bacciconi with partial support from Titas Chanda
